# Snake-Game :snake:
create a snake game that runs on your web browser using javascript.

## Technologies used:
- I used P5.js which is a javascript library oriented towards visual arts. You can learn more about it [here](https://p5js.org/).

## todo:
- display the controlls in the start, end, pause menus
- want to add a transparent pause menu
- need to make sure the food does not spawn on any part of the snake
